## 🎯 Why Google Dorking is Powerful for OSINT

Google Dorking goes beyond ordinary searches by uncovering information that isn't readily accessible through traditional search methods. This includes:
- Files containing sensitive information (e.g., `site:example.com filetype:pdf`)
- Exposed databases and credentials (`inurl:admin` or `intitle:index.of`)
- Websites vulnerable to attacks (e.g., `inurl:.php?id=` for SQL injections)

By leveraging **DorkSearch**, you’re not just browsing the web—you’re exploring hidden data and vulnerabilities, making this tool perfect for investigative work, ethical hacking, and academic research.
